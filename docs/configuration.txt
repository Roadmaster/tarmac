==============================
Basic Configuration for Tarmac
==============================

Introduction
============

  Tarmac gets it's configuration data from ``~/.config/tarmac/tarmac.conf`` --
The configuration is split up by projects.  As an example, Tarmac will
demonstrate its own config throughout this project.  To start with, the Tarmac
project should be added to the config (with the file being created if it
doesn't exist already).::

  [tarmac]
  # Configuration for the Tarmac project


Logging
=======

  The log file, by default, is set to ``~/.config/tarmac/<project-name>``.  In
order to change this location, simply set the log_file setting, as shown
below::

  [tarmac]
  # Configuration for the Tarmac project
  log_file=/path/to/logfile
